Since we need to calculate different values (salary, gpa etc.) in different function (add, multiply, average, max, min)
we need to distinguish different shares from different people so we need to format the name of shares
for example like what we output in MPC lab in txt file
we will have format below for shares
[sender number]_[receiver number]_[type].txt
for example party member P3 send share of salary to P2 will be in file
3_2_salary.txt

After we have done the calculation, and received others' output which is ready to merge and get our result
We will name them in format:
[sender number]_[type]_[function].txt
For example, party member P3 finish calculating sum of share of salary and the output P3 send will be in file
3_salary_sum.txt
